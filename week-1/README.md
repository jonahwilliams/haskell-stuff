# Week 1

Armed with 'Learn You a Haskell' and 'Haskell from First Principles', I've set
off to learn the language.  While I've done some "Baby's first functional programming"
in Python and JavaScript (With a shot detour though Apache Spark), MLs are
pretty unknown to me. I'm completely unfamiliar with the ecosystem and the tools,
but this is actually nice. I can just write code without worrying if someone
already wrote a package for it!

Writing some familiar sorting algorithms was extremely gratifying, all the
implementation details just sort of fall away, leaving you with the essence.  
Lists and Trees have been fun so far, but I fear I'll soon have to venture into
something a bit more advanced.  I'm not really sure If I actually know how to
write Heaps or RB Trees or if I've just memorized some code.  One way or another,
I'll figure out how to do it in Haskell.
